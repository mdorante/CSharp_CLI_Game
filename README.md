# CLI Game

In this game you are given a grid, in order to win the game, you have to find the glitch in the matrix (not really, I just wanted it to sound cool lol).

Now seriously, you are given an all **0**'s matrix and in order to win this game, you have to fill the grid up with **1**'s before you run out of turns. (Sounds easy, right?)

## Instructions

The game consists in trying to convert an all **0**'s grid into all **1**'s.
In order to do this, you have to select a coordinate `(x, y)`, this will switch the element at that coordinate and all adjacent elements (up, down, left and right).
By switch I mean, if the element is a `0`, it will turn into a `1` or vice versa.

You also have two extra commands:

- Save
- Load
